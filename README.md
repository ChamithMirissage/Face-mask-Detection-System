# Face-mask detection system

A system which can be used to identify the people who are not wearing face masks. First an image is input to the system. This consists of two models; face detection model and mask detection model. The face detection model was developed using yolov3. The mask detection model was developed by transfer learning the Resnet50 classification model. At the first stage, face detection model detects the faces of people in the image. That faces are input to the mask detection model. It identify whether each face has mask or not. Finally it outputs the images of faces which not having masks. Then user can identify the people who not wearing masks. I deployed this system in the localhost.
